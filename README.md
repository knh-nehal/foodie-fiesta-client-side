### Features of this Website

- Users can create accounts and log in securely to access the website's features. This ensures that each user has a personalized experience and can manage their own food listings and requests.

- Logged-in users can add food items to the website, similar to creating a restaurant menu. They can specify details such as the name of the dish, expiry date, availabilty, quantity and any other relevant information. However, a user cannot request their own food listings to maintain fairness and prevent self-promotion.

- Users can browse through the list of available food items added by other users and request items they are interested in trying. Once a request is made, it's recorded in a table for easy reference.

- The website provides a dedicated interface for users to view their requested food items. This interface includes details such as the status of the food, the user who added the food, pickup location and any additional notes.

- The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices of various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This means users can access and interact with the website comfortably regardless of the device they are using, enhancing accessibility and usability.
